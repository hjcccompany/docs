# Build the Docs

You're now ready to build the new ownCloud docs.
Let's assume you've made a change to some aspect of the documentation, whether large or small, and you want to rebuild the docs and preview the changes.
There are two ways to doing so, depending on how you installed Antora.

## Using the Docker Container

From the command line, in the root of the docs directory, run the command:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) antora/antora:latest generate site.yml
```

This command starts up the Antora Docker container, removes the existing documentation, and then runs Antora’s generate command, an regenerates the documentation.
If all goes well, you will _not_ see any console output.

## Running Antora From The Command-Line

From the command line, in the root of the docs directory, run the command:

```
antora site.yml
```

If all goes well, you will _not_ see any console output.

## Viewing Build Errors

If an aspect of your change contains invalid AsciiDoc, then you'll see output similar to the example below.

```console
asciidoctor: ERROR: index.adoc: line 25: only book doctypes can contain level 0 sections
```

There, you can see:

- That an error was found
- The file it was found in
- The line of that file where it is located

## Viewing Changes

Assuming that there are no errors, the next thing to do is to run the [NPM Serve tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) so that you can view your changes, before committing and pushing the changes to the remote docs repository.
We suggest using it, as it’s trivial to install and start.
You could also use [PHP’s built-in webserver](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) as well.
By using either of these, you don’t have to install and configure a complete webserver, such as Apache or NGINX.

To start *Serve*, run the following command:

```
serve public &
```

This starts Serve, using the `public` directory, (re)generated by `antora site.yml`, as the document root, listening on `http://localhost:5000`.

Open the URL in your browser of choice and you'll see two links, as below.

Click "**server/**", and you'll see the local copy of the documentation.

If you're happy with your changes, as with any other change, create a set of meaningful commits and push them to the remote repository.

We hope that you can see that contributing to the documentation using Antora is a pretty straight-forward process, and not _that_ demanding.
